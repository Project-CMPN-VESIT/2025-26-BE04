## 📌 About JeevanSetu

**JeevanSetu** (meaning *"Bridge of Life"*) is a high-performance, full-stack digital platform designed to modernize and unify the operations of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Developed in direct collaboration with the **Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation** — a child welfare NGO dedicated to the rehabilitation and education of underprivileged children in Mumbai — the platform addresses the chronic inefficiencies caused by manual record-keeping, fragmented tools, and a lack of transparency in the non-profit sector.

The platform serves as a **single source of truth** for NGO operations, replacing error-prone paperwork and disconnected spreadsheets with automated, data-driven workflows that are transparent, secure, and scalable.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Most NGOs in India still operate through:

- 📋 Manual spreadsheets and paper-based donor records
- 💬 Fragmented communication via WhatsApp and social media
- ❌ No real-time donation tracking or financial transparency
- 📉 No analytics to make evidence-based decisions
- 🔓 Sensitive data stored insecurely with no role-based access

This leads to donor distrust, administrative bottlenecks, and an inability to scale social impact.

---

## ✅ The Solution — JeevanSetu

JeevanSetu introduces a **unified web-based ecosystem** built on four pillars:

### 🔗 1. Blockchain-Backed Donation Transparency
Every donation is automatically recorded on an **Ethereum blockchain ledger** via Solidity smart contracts. This creates an immutable, tamper-proof trail of fund movement — donors can verify exactly when and how their contribution was logged, rebuilding the trust bridge between NGOs and their supporters.

### 📊 2. Real-Time Analytics Dashboards
Fragmented data from donors, campaigns, and volunteers is consolidated into **interactive dashboards** powered by a Flask microservice. NGO leadership can monitor KPIs, track campaign velocity, and make informed decisions in real time.

### 💳 3. Integrated Donation Processing
Seamless online donations via **Razorpay** supporting UPI, Cards, Net Banking, and Wallets. Instant digital receipts are generated automatically, eliminating manual acknowledgement.

### 🛡️ 4. Centralized & Secure Data Management
All organizational, financial, and beneficiary records are stored in a **single MongoDB repository** with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring sensitive data is only accessible by authorized personnel.
